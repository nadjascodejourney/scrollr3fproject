# Animated Scroll Website with React Three Fiber and GSAP

This project is a simple interactive 3D web application build for selfstudy purposes. My goal is to use 3D web technologies in combination with scroll-based animations to offer an immersive user experience.

## Project Overview

The application utilizes the following technologies:

- Vite & React: For fast development and optimized build management.
- react-three/fiber: Integration of Three.js with React for a reactive 3D rendering environment.
- react-three/drei: Extension of react-three/fiber with useful helper components.
- Three.js: WebGL based library for 3D graphics on the web.
- CSS & Tailwind CSS: For styling and layout.
- GSAP: For animations.

## Features

- Scroll-Based Animations: Interactive 3D animations controlled by scrolling
- Including particles, 3D objects, and an Overlay to display HTML in front of the Canvas
- Responsive Camera Behavior: The camera dynamically responds to mouse movements and scrolling (i.e. parallax effect)
- It works responsive on different sizes
